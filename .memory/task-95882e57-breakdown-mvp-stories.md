# Break down MVP stories into tasks

## Objective
Create task-level breakdown for the MVP stories so execution can begin with clear, testable steps.

All MVP stories under epic `fc65689b`.

## Steps
1. Review newly defined stories and acceptance criteria.
2. Define tasks for each story (implementation, testing, UX, security, perf) with clear objectives and expected outcomes.
3. Add tasks to `.memory/todo.md` and link them from the relevant story files.
4. Confirm sequencing with phases (1–4) and note dependencies.

## Expected Outcome
A set of linked task files covering all MVP stories, ready for execution and prioritization.

## Actual Outcome
Pending.

## Lessons Learned
TBD.
