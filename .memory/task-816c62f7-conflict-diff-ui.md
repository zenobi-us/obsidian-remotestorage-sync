# Implement conflict resolution diff UI

## Objective
Provide git-diff-style conflict resolution UI integrated with CRDT merge results and user approvals.

## Related Story
- [Presence, conflict resolution UI, and manual sync controls](story-3920916f-presence-conflicts-controls.md)

## Steps
1. Capture CRDT merge conflicts and generate diff views for notes within scoped content.
2. Allow users to resolve/accept merges or choose versions; persist decisions back to CRDT/doc.
3. Add tests for conflict display and resolution workflows, including offline/reconnect scenarios.

## Expected Outcome
Conflicts are presented clearly with user-driven resolution and safe merges.

## Actual Outcome
Pending.

## Lessons Learned
TBD.
