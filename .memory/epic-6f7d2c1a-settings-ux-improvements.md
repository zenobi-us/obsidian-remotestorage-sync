# Settings UX Improvements

## Vision/Goal
- Improve the clarity, organization, and usability of plugin settings to reduce confusion, streamline configuration, and support incremental adoption of features.

## Success Criteria
- Settings are grouped logically with clear labels, descriptions, and defaults.
- Advanced or experimental options are clearly marked and gated.
- Common tasks (enable/disable sync, select scope, manage peers) are discoverable in under 2 clicks.
- Users can understand the impact of changes without external documentation.

## Phases
- Phase 1: Inventory existing settings and UX pain points.
- Phase 2: Re-organize settings with improved copy and grouping.
- Phase 3: Add guidance, affordances, and validation for critical settings.

## Dependencies
- Blocked by current epic: P2P Obsidian Vault Collaboration (`epic-fc65689b`).
- Ad hoc stories will be captured while completing the current epic.
